# Final Project: Newton's Cradles

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge I've acquired in this course and apply it to a small-scale project. The project focuses on Newton's Cradles, a common teaching tool in physics classes.

## Feature
In the project, elements such as color, lighting, and shadows are employed. When the spheres collide, they change color. Above the Newton's Cradles, there is a light source that continuously revolves, causing the shadows on the ground to constantly shift. Pressing the 's' key can toggle the shadow feature on or off, and pressing the 'p' key switches to a viewpoint resembling a pirate ship at an amusement park, giving the impression that you are sitting on one of the spheres, following its motion.
