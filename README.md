# Final Project: Newton's Cradles

## Description
This OpenGL project showcases the fascinating aspects of computer graphics by rendering dynamic 3D geometries. Key features of this project include:

- **Dynamic Color Changes:** Witness the spheres change their color as they collide, demonstrating the responsiveness of the system to interactions within the 3D environment.
- **Interactive Lighting and Shadows:** Observe the impact of a continuously revolving light source positioned above the Newton's Cradles. This creates a visually engaging and ever-changing pattern of shadows on the ground, adding depth and realism to the scene.
- **Real-Time Shadow Manipulation:** Users can interact with the scene by toggling the shadow feature on and off using the 's' key. This feature allows for a demonstration of the impact of shadows in 3D rendering.
- **Pirate Ship Viewpoint:** Engage with the scene from a unique perspective by pressing the 'p' key. This switches the view to resemble that of a pirate ship at an amusement park, where you feel as if you are sitting on one of the spheres and following its motion.

These features collectively offer an immersive experience in 3D graphics, utilizing OpenGL to its full potential to create a visually stunning and interactive environment.
